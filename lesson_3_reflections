When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on a project with a team.  Using a remote repo allows and facilitates collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
An automatic update may overright soemthign you are working on.  Better to make the decision of appropriate
updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is creating a different path from the master string within a repo.  You can use this to track
updates you are not ready to commit to the master (ie experimental changes).  A clone is pulling a copy
of a repo from github or another computer to your local computer.  You do this such that you can work on
updates locally and then push up later.  A fork is basically a clone within GitHub.  You use this to create
your own project that stems from an existing project.
