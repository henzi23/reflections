What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created.  This is needed as it is the hiddenfile that will track changes
once commits are created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
It allows us to decide which changes we wantt o commit and which changes are still in process for should be
committed seperately.
